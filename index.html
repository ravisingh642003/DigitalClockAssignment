          Tick tock...tick tock...<br />
          Life is counting down on your internal clock.<br /><br />
          Memories that feel as if they occurred yesterday<br />
          turn to flashes of moments that seem to fade away.<br />
          People you once knew <br />walk by without a clue. <br />The times you
          once shared <br />exist as if you were never there. <br />Years
          fly...friends die... <br />and you never know when you'll say your
          last goodbye. <br />
          Oh, how I wish I could turn back time, <br />spend it with loved ones
          and cherish what once was mine. <br />
          Or to go back even more, <br />being a kid in a candy store. <br />How
          I miss the way I used to feel <br />on Christmas day when Santa was
          real. <br />
          But back to reality...back to today, <br />family is scarce and
          memories continue to fade away. <br />
          Tick tock...tick tock... <br />How I wish I could control this clock.
